With my two years of experience as a Recruitment Consultant, I've learned the nuances of talent sourcing, assessment, and successful placement within the tech industry. I specialize in the intricate world of IT recruitment.

Over the years, I've honed a unique blend of skills – combining the strategic insight of marketing with the people-first approach of HR. My adeptness in leveraging platforms like LinkedIn, Naukri, and Cutshort ensures I remain at the forefront of digital talent acquisition. Collaborating with HR teams, managing a diverse client portfolio, and driving recruitment & selection processes with precision are some of the daily activities I'm deeply passionate about.

But beyond the mechanics of recruitment, I believe in the power of genuine relationships. By nurturing trust with both clients and candidates, I ensure that the recruitment journey is more than just a transaction—it's a partnership.

You can connect with me to learn more about my work experience and skills, and I will be happy to discuss them. Thank you.
